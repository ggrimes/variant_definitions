# Standardised Variant Definitions

This is a repository containing the up-to-date lineage definitions for variants of concern (VOC) and variants of interest (VUI)for the Scottish waste water surveillance project as curated by Graeme Grimes.

They are provided in order to facilitate standardised VOC and VUI calling. 

The mutations have been chosen to aid rapid and sensitive identification from sequence data: these are typically only a subset of the total set of mutations found in a variant. 

Variant definitions are subject to change at any time. The latest release can be downloaded under the releases tab. A <a href="CHANGELOG.md">CHANGELOG</a> is available. For email notifications when this repository is updated, please use the GitHub "Watch" functionality at the top right of this page.
